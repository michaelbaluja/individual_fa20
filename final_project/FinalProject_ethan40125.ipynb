    "With over 40,000 acres of park assets and over 400 parks, the City of San Diego provides a robust public park system for its community (1). Through the various environmental, aesthetic, and recreation benefits parks offer to the community, parks significantly improve the quality and wellfare of its surrounding neighborhoods and boost economic development for the overall city (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the goals of parks are to provide positive experiences for visitors, not everyone goes into a park with the same set of motivations. Most people use parks for recreation, rest and leisure activities, but some use it for their homes. The constant public complaints of homeless populations are costly for the parks and city governments, for many believe they negatively affect the city's public image and drains much attention and budget for cities to carry out measures (3)(4). Poverty and unemployment are both major factors that tie to homelessness (5). With the high cost of living in San Diego, 49% higher than the national average (6), cutting down housing cost is often prioritized by people who are struggling economically. One way to understand the quality of experiences visitors have in parks is through visitor reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp reviews are a great source of information to understand how a park fares among its visitors based on a 1 (worst) to 5 (best) star rating system. A park that generally provides a poorer quality of experience will receive a lower rating (less stars), and a park that generally provides a positive experience will receive a more favorable rating (more stars). \n",

    "I hypothesize that zip codes with higher unemployment levels will have lower average park ratings, and zip codes with higher poverty levels will also result in lower average park ratings. Parks in zip codes with a higher unemployment and poverty levels may represent a larger homeless population, and higher amounts of homeless activities around parks may contribute to more negative experiences for other people at parks."

    "I obtained the datasets used in this project from my instructor, so I have permission to access and use these data. Both these data are sourced from the internet's public domain, so even if the data were not provided I could still obtain them individually and proceed with my projects. This project is not used for commercial purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both datasets I used in this project do not contain information that exposes individual identities. Therefore, none of the rows or columns in my dataset needed to be dropped for ethical reasons. The addresses in the datasets are for census tracts and public parks, which are both knowledge accessible to the public. \n",
    "\n",
    "There may be biases in my analysis.\n",
    "The Yelp review counts were kept in my analysis because I wanted to visualize the distribution of Yelp reviews. Turns out, the distribution of Yelp reviews was heavily right-skewed, indicating that a high number of public parks in San Diego have little to no reviews. As a result, the parks with few reviews would hold a disproportionally larger weight when calculating the average rating of parks in a given zip code. Knowing this, I proceeded with my analysis anyway because I reason that parks with few reviews still represent visitors' experience at parks, and over the long run, the very high and low ratings of parks with little reviews shall balance out to the average.\n",
    "Another possible bias in my analysis is that although there may be a negative correlation between poverty/unemployment levels and park ratings, the correlation may be better explained by a lurking variable that I did not anticipate (ex. unemployed people are in generally worse mood, more prone to giving negative ratings). Therefore, the results of this project cannot be used to infer causation.\n",
    "Yet another possible bias is that since I calculated averages of unemployment/poverty levels and park ratings based on zip codes, the average values used in my analysis may be skewed due to few extreme values. \n",
    "\n",
    "One unintended consequence for this project is that one may quickly presume that the negative correlation between unemployment and average park ratings result from the homeless population, and blame the negative reviews of public parks on the homeless population. Any insights gained from this project do not justify hateful language or behavior towards the homeless population.\n",

    "In this project, I compared the average unemployment and poverty levels and average park ratings among zip codes in San Diego and tried to find if any relationship exists between unemployment and poverty level vs. average park ratings. I notice that there exists negative correlations between both unemployment levels and poverty levels vs. average park ratings. I first cleaned my each my datasets used for this project. Then I merge them into one dataframe for a smoother analysis. Finally, I use regression analysis to see if there are any relationships between the variables in my dataset.  \n",

    "My hypothesis that zip codes with higher unemployment levels and higher poverty levels correspond to lower average park ratings match the results of my analysis. However, as mentioned in the abov section, there may be several limitations regarding my conclusion. Firstly, there may be many contributing factors as to why higher unemployment levels and poverty levels correlate with more negative park reviews (such as city budget and other environment conditions). Secondly, using a linear regression model to draw conclusions for the relationship between unemployment and poverty levels vs park ratings may be overly simple, as other models and tools may provide a more suitible approach to analyzing my data.   \n",

    "This project provides the insight to San Diego city officials that areas with higher unemployment and poverty levels tend to have lower park ratings, and it may help the city to better decide how to allocate its resources to improve park ratings and therefore the park experience for its residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project may also open ways for future research and analysis and what further factors tied to unemployment and poverty levels contribute to lower ratings of parks, as well as to examine why there is a stronger negative correlation between unemployment levels and park ratings than poverty levels and park ratings.\n"
