    "I started this project to see whether people would prefer to visit large parks to small parks, assuming that the amount of visitors to a park is proportional to the amount of Yelp reviews it gets. After my research, I conclude that there's a linear relationship between the park size and the amount of Yelp reviews it gets. If I were to give advice to the park system of San Diego county, I would include the park size in my decision. "

    "Although park visitors help generate the awareness and income to preserve the natural habitats, they can also throw off the balance of the existing ecosystems. A research by Johnson & Wales University [1] points out that all visitors have some degree of negative impact on the environments. Hence, understanding the factors that predict the patterns of visitor behavior in the park is crucial to mantain the current infrastructures, natural resources, and visitors experience. A study by Utah State University [2] found that resource-related factors, such as terrain, resource condition, presence of wildlife, etc., may influence visitor behavior more than visitor characteristics, such as education level, activity expertise, or familiarity with minimum-impact recreation practices. Another study published in the International Journal of Geo-Information [3] suggests that the higher the park budget, the more visitors it gets, and the higher the employee number, the fewer visitors it gets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I want to find out if the size of the park can predict the amount of visitors it will get. Since it was challenging to find the exact data on the amount of visitors to San Diego parks, I use the amount of Yelp reviews of each park as a measurement of its popularity. Yelp is a popular website where users can post reviews for any business and public places, including parks. Even though Yelp is not completely reliable, as a study found that 20% of restaurant reviews in 2013 on the site is fake [4], public parks are non-profit so there is not point in writing fake reviews for them so we can trust the Yelp reviews on parks were written by real park visitors.\n",

    "Personally, I always prefer to visit large parks than small parks because they are more entertaining and pretty. However, I can't generalize this preference to the public because there could be other factors that affect the popularity of a park. However, my hypothesis is that large parks will get more visitors than small parks. Since visitors will post Yelp reviews, large parks will get more Yelp reviews than small parks."

    "To get the data into a usable format, I wrangle data from both the Yelp dataset and the Park geojson dataset. First, I imported 834 San Diego park information from the Yelp dataset. Then, drop unnecessary columns like address, phone, Yelp id, url, longitutde, latitude, and is_closed to increase the processing speed. After that, I drop observations with missing values and duplicates. From screening the data, I see that data appears to be in good quality but a few observations have the same park name and different location, and some have different reviews. To avoid confusion, I decide to drop the duplicate Yelp reviews with the same park name. After that, I sort the dataframe alphabetically by name so I can add a column for the park size that matches with the park name once I process data from the Park geojson dataset.\n",

A concern I have is that Yelp forbids data collecting but the dataset I used was collected by using Yelp API, a tool created by Yelp so the Yelp was ethically collected. The Park geojson dataset was collected from the San Diego government website so it was also ethically collected. Both datasets have no privacy concern.\n",

    "After cleaning 2769 observations, I got 110 observations left to carry out the analysis. To my surpise, the initial OSL analysis before data transformation shows that there is a linear relationship between the park size and the amount of Yelp reviews it has even though that relationship doesn't make sense. Although my p-value was within the range that indicate there is a relationship between the park size and the amount of Yelp reviews it get, there are a few limitations in my research that may not warrant this finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, both datasets I used have a lot of redundancy and duplication. There are a lot of parks with the same name but different park size, a few with the same name but different address. With the constraint of time, I choose to keep the first park that appeared in the dataset. Secondly, I only got 110 observations to work with, which is too little to produce good conclusion. I was expecting more from the combination of 834 and 2769 data points. Lastly, I didn't remove the outliers from the data that I use for OSL analysis so despite the reasonable p-value, my linear function is `review_count = 65.8229 + 0.1577 * gis_acres`, which is suspicious because that means the minimum number of reviews a park get is 65 reviews. From the EDA section, 75% of parks has less than 48 Yelp reviews. \n",
    "\n",
    "To correct my limitation, since my datasets were skewed, I applied log transformation. I end up with a more reasonable relationship between the park size and the amount of Yelp reviews it has. `review_count = 0.8013 + 0.4282 * gis_acres`\n",
    "\n",
    "From my research, I found the linear relationship between park size and its Yelp review count. San Diego park system can use the park size or its popularity on Yelp to predict which park to pay more attention to."
