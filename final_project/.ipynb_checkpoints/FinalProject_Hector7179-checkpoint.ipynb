    "In this project, I tried to explore if there was a postive correlation between yelp ratings and gis_acres of parks in San Diego. Throughout the course of my analysis, I found that although there was evidence that gis_acres may significantly predict rating when alpha = 0.05, the correlation was really weak between the two variables. Overall, the data suggests that there may be only little evidence that people tend to enjoy themselves more in larger parks as opposed to smaller ones."

    "After living in San Diego for the better part of 3 years I have been to over a handful of small, neighborhood parks around the area that I live in and only one large park (Balboa Park). When I went to Balboa park, I remember distinctly how there were lots of people walking around or engaging in some activity. It was busier than most parks I have been too and I associated that with the idea that this park must be very liked. Conversely, whenever I would go to the smaller parks around my area, I would notice that they tended to by empty in both activities one could do, and number or people. This got me thinking if smaller parks were less liked than their bigger counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the background work that I have gathered, it appears to me that bigger parks do tend to be more popular than smaller parks because there is often more to do in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "USA Today compiled a list of the best parks in San Diego. All of the parks mentioned in the list were relatively large parks. These parks either had large spaces for activits, gardens, close proximity to the beach, hiking trails, etc. There were no mentionings of small parks at all in the list. This reinforces my hypothesis that large parks are more liked than smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "An article by Andrew Price titles, \"Grand Parks vs. Neighborhood\" makes a distinction between \"Grand Parks\" and \"Neighborhood Parks\" that gave me ideas as to why larger parks may be more liked than smaller ones. He brought up the point that to lots of people, neighborhood parks may seem irrelevant because they don't offer activites they could already do in their homes. Whereas grand parks offer opportunities for new experiences and excitement which neighborhood parks can't provide. I believe that because larger parks tend to have more excitement than smaller parks, they will receive better ratings on yelp because of the more fun experience people have in larger parks as opposed to a more mundane experience you could expect from a smaller park.\n",

The primary information I would be looking for would be the name of parks, size of the park, some sort of rating scale I could use as an indication of how people felt about the park. Ideally, I would want to have this information on the parks throughout the years to see if a trend is present regarding the relationship between size of parks and people's ratings of them. Ideally, I think it would be best to store the observations in a datframe where the columns would be for the variables I am interested in exploring and the rows would be each park in San Diego as an observation.\n",

    "Being that parks are for the public, the information on them was also be publicly available. The biggest privacy concern I can currently see would be If my study would at some point need information on the people visiting the parks that could be personal. In that case I would take measures to be granted permission to use personal information and ensure the privacy of participants by maintining there data anonymous.\n",
    "A potential bias that I see involves the location of the parks in San Diego. There are parks in San Diego that reside in both wealthier areas of the city and poorer ones. This could potentially lead to bias in my study If I am not careful.\n",
    "In order to deal with these potential issues I will need to first ensure that all the data I gather is available for me to use. To enusre this I will do my due diligence to research the parks in San Diego to see what information I can and can't use and also ask informed consent if needed. I will also need to ensure that I maintain the privacy of my data by keeping any personal information anonymous. For the biases my project may face, I will need to attempt to find as many cofounding variables as possible that may lead my study to produce biased results. These are all concerns that I had before completing my research which I used to mold my project and I addressed all the issues that I potentially had."

    "After completing my research, I found weak correlation between ratings and gis_acres. Using scatter plots, correlation, and a linear model, I was able to see that the two variables I focused on are not well correlated. However, I did find evidence that gis_acres can weakly predict ratings at an alpha level of 0.05. Overall, I can say that my hypotheses was not totally incorrect as I did predict a positive correlation. However, I did not find enough evidence to suggest that people give better ratings to larger parks because they often offer more excitement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest limitation I had in this project was the number of observations I had available after cleaning. Had I had more time, I would have focused on coming up with a better cleaning method so that I could include more parks into my study. Another limitation was that I had to change my original research idea because there was not enough data to connduct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Had I found that there was indeed a strong relationship between ratings and size of parks, It could have provided support for focusing money on creating more big parks instead of smaller ones. However that was not the case so this research does not have much potential to have a large impact on society."
