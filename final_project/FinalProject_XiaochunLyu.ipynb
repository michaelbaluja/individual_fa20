    "It is no news that San Diego is facing a homeless crisis that is affecting the public spaces of the city. Assuming the role of a SD Parks and Rec analyst, I tried to find out if the presence of homeless people is a significant factor in negative Yelp reviews of the parks in San Diego. By applying TF-IDF to two sets of documents which respectively contains good and bad Yelp reviews of parks in San Diego, I was able to find out that the homeless population in parks is indeed a significant reason for bad reviews."

    "Sasn Diego has had the problem of homelessness for a long time, and parks in San Diego are suffering from this problem too. In Sep, 2017, a large crackdown on homeless camps \"has forced people without shelter into Balboa Park and other parts of the city\"(1). Another report by KPBS in Jan, 2020 detailed the deteriorating at Lamar Park in Spring Valley: \"Everyday there's a new tent that comes, everyday new people, new people. Sometimes it's families. Sometimes it's just single people. It's out of control,” Greer, a homeless person, said. She says she has asked the county for help in finding a place to stay. But she hasn't been offered assistance.(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the public opinion into account, the situation doesn't look good for everyone, people visiting the parks are being put off by the presence of homeless people, and the homeless themselves also admit that they are in the parks because they have no choice: Chapman, a homeless person at Larmar park told KPBS reporter that \"To me it's embarrassing to have to be there to be on top of a park...I can only imagine what parents are feeling. But for us homeless who are elderly, it's the safest place that we feel, it's on a main drag, there's a restroom here.\"(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Efforts have been made to alleviate the situation to some effect: Accoridng to another KPBS report, San Diego County's homeless population dropped 6% from 2019, with a 12% reduction in the number of unsheltered homeless people, according to figures released by the Regional Task Force on the Homeless.(3) However, more remains to be done in order to fully address the homeless crisis in San Diego, especially in parks around the city.\n",

  {

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "I think homelessness is likely a significant factor that prompts people to write negative reviews of the parks. My hypothesis comes from skimming the Yelp review dataset, where it seems like a bad review of a park is more likely to mention homeless in the park. Having visited several parks in San Diego my self, I also think that the parks are well maintained and have good facilities. Therefore, I speculate that when people are writing bad reviews, they are more likely to focus on external issues such as homeless people rather than the parks themselves. "

    "- Number of observations: 2333\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: The Yelp review data is a csv dataset that contains Yelp reviews of parks under SD Parks and Rec. The dataset includes up to three reviews (review score from 1-5 and review text) for each park and is curated by Professor Ellis with the Yelp API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are reviews for other locations in the Yelp review dataset, I will be extracting the names of all parks under SD Parks and Rec from the Park Locations dataset and using this list of names to filter out all review entries in the Yelp review dataset so that I am only working with reviews of parks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I would like to explain the limitations on the Yelp review dataset: Because of the limitation of the Yelp API, each location in the dataset is capped at three reviews only, meaning that for locations with more than three reviews, I could not get every review to form the whole picture. Another limitation of the Yelp API is that the API will decide which review is included in the dataset if there are more than three reviews for a location, and the exact rules of selecting the reviews is unknown. Therefore, The three reviews for a location in the Yelp dataset may not realistically reflect people's thoughts on that location. A third limitation of the Yelp API is that it will truncate review text if it is too long, resulting in loss of information in many entries of the Yelp review dataset. This has the similar implication as the second limitation since it prevents me from accessing and interpreting whole review texts from the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final limitation on the datasets is that the park names in the Park Locations dataset sometimes do not match up with the park names in the Yelp review dataset, resulting in me not being able to find all parks and their reviews in the Yelp review dataset. To alleviate the problem, I will be matching locations using both the \"name\" and the \"alias\" feature of the Park Location dataset so that I can get as many reviews about parks as I can in the Yelp review dataset.\n"

Since I am doing TF-IDF on the reviews, even if there are a few gibberish reviews, the resulting bias would not be too big since: 1) a few meaningless words will not rank too high on the TF-IDF scale. 2) I am looking at words individually so the context is already removed in the process."

Notice that the words that ranked higher than homeless: \"park\", \"I\", \"...\" and \"'s\" are all relatively common (meaningless) for the analysis, which further reinforced my guess that homeless people in parks is an important factor in negative reviews.

    "Ethics:\n",
    "Since I am basing my project on the Yelp review dataset that comes with a lot of limitations, I would like to detail my concern on ethics of this project. I do have the permission to use the data, as the Park Location data is public accessible and the Yelp review data is curated by Professor Ellis. However, the numerous limitations on my project and the ethics concerns they pose is worth discussing here. Since the Yelp review datset cannot realistically reflect what people think about the parks due to the limitation of three comments only and review truncating, my data is likely to contain bias that affects my text analysis. Additionally, because I am employing word frequency analysis in my EDA and IF-IDF in my formal analysis, I am removing the context of individual words in the comments, thus introducing additional bias into my analysis. This is expecially true for the word \"homeless\". Since I am only comparing the TF-IDF scores of this word in good comments and bad comments, I can only know how important this word is to the set of good reviews and bad reviews, but can never fully grasp what people want to say when they mentioned \"homeless\" in the reviews. In short, given the limitations in both the dataset and my methods, my research is prone to paint a wrong picture about homeless people and park reviews. Finally, my research is only directed at Yelp reviews of parks in SD, therefore the results is can neither represent the parks and homeless people elsewhere, nor represent the thoughts of people who wrote reviews on a platform other than Yelp, as well as the thoughts of people who didn't write any reviews at all. I would like to make it clear that my research is not to be misused in anyway that paints a skewed picture of the homeless poputation in San Diego and park reviews/reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Privacy:\n",
    "The two datasets I used in my project contain little privacy concerns due to the following reasons: \n",
    "1) The Park Location dataset simply does not contain any personal information since it only contains the locations and ther information of parks.\n",
    "2) The Yelp review dataset is retrieved using the Yelp API, and the API already stripped all information about the Yelp users that posted these reviews.\n",
    "3) The only place where personal information can be present is in the review themselves, as there is a non-zero chance that a reviewer accidentally revealed personal information in his/her reviews. However, such case is not only rare, but has less impact because when a person writes a review and posts it online, the person is already consenting to release the review to a public domain for everyone to view.\n",
    "Although the data I used contains little privacy concern, I would still insist on keeping the data and my project undisclosed because there is a chance that the review section contains personally identifiable information, and it is out of my ability to identify and delete these information since I will have to manually read through all review entries."

    "Based on the analysis which revealed a huge difference in TF-IDF scores for the word \"homeless\" in good reviews and bad reviews of parks in San Diego, I conclude my hypothesis that the presence of homeless population is a significant factor that contributes to negative Yelp reviews of parks under SD Parks and Rec is right. And this conclusion may provide more incentive for the city to provide shelter/housing to its homeless population as it creates a win-win scenario: the homeless people are provided with housing, and people will have more positive opinions on parks in San Diego since the homeless population, a significant factor contributing to nagative reviews, is no longer in the parks. \n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to reiterate that my project contains numerous limitations introduced by the dataset and my methodology, and in no way representative of the whole situation regarding the homeless population and parks in San Diego. Apart from the data-introduced limitations which I cannot work around, my method of using TF-IDF only also introduced limitations to my analysis since TF-IDF only looks at the relevancy of individual words and removes all context.
